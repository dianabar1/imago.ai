# imago.ai
An AI-powered brainstorming tool for writer-artist collaboration 

Made with:
* Stable Diffusion ([Replicate API](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/api))

imago.ai is a reference image brainstorming tool for bridging writer-artist communication powered by Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image AI model. Artists can **a)** view the original text and writer requests for illustrations while **b)** generating reference images. ImagExplorer also **c)** provides suggestions for prompts and starting images to feed into Stable Diffusion. Generated images are **d)** displayed on the right, and once artists are satisfied with the results, they can perform additional actions **e)** such as downloading or sharing images with the writer.
